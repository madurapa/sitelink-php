# SiteLink API Integration in PHP for Self Storage Websites

SiteLink's self-storage software helps small and large self-storage operators manage their self-storage tenants and grow profits while reducing costs.

## Introduction

This code base is written in PHP and used CodeIgniter Web Framework 3 but if you can get the idea, you can implement this into any framework even into any language. You can read the documentation at http://www.codeigniter.com/user_guide/


## The Plot

When I got a project from a client to integrate SiteLink API to their site I was searching for some reference to get some help but I ended up with nothing. I only had their API doc but with the API doc you can do almost nothing. I think they should provide more details. I’m going to list down what are the cons with their documentation.
* There is no explanation about which steps you have to fallow (which method you have to call in first place and which one next and so on…)
* Some method’s parameter names are different than in the API doc.
* Lack of code samples with different languages.

But their support team is just amazing… They always be there to help you at anytime. This code base is here just because of their help. You can reach them at apisupport@sitelink.com
